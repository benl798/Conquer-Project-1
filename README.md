# Conquer

This is Ben Luck's project, built as part of the Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly, Sydney.

Conquer is a web-based fitness application that enables users to create an account and login where a number of various workouts are presented to them. Within the application users have the option to edit their account to amend or delete information about their profile, view various workouts already created as well as create their own workouts using the exercises already displayed or alternatively can chose to add their own along with additional personal features about that exercise e.g description.

## Objectives
- Models. Your app should have at least 3 models.
- Views. Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
- Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle   incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- Use Gems Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app.
- Cloudinary
- User Login. Make sure you have basic authentication.
- Heroku. Deploy your code to Heroku.


## Technologies Used

I used Ruby on Rails, CSS and HTML to build this application.


## Bugs and bits to continue working on

There are still a number of features and issues to resolve before this project is complete. Immediately callouts include: Password requirement (extending the length), styling and CSS - ensuring the background doesn't carry across if the page content goes past one page and being more mindful of having text on top of images.

 I would also like to enable users to add multiple different exercises to their own workout instead of the current case which limits them to creating only a single new exercise when creating their new workout.
